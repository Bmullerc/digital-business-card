## Thoughts and/or What I've learned

- Not really confortable using my own picture, just not that type of person
- Still grasping the basics of React, but feeling confortable and liking it a lot so far
- SASS and BEM became pretty much second nature by now
- Create React is easy to use, thought I would have trouble with Netlify or even Github uploading, but its very easy
- I always forget about Fontawesome and end up going through the trouble of adding SVG's and changing colors when I could just simply add the icon with a simple tag and link import...

## Going forward

- Getting deeper with React and Javascript, still too soon for Typescript, React Native and Redux
- Starting a big React project to maybe add to my portfolio
